- 👋 Hi, I’m @programxcore
- 👀 I’m interested in game engines, 3d games, 3d modelling, 2d games
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C
- 💞️ I will eventually be open to collaborating on games that explore anarchist, decolonial and anti-capitalist ideas and potentialities
    (after I learn more and get some practice in)
